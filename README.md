# RazerTOP

[Razer keyboards](https://www.razer.com/ca-en/gaming-keyboards) feature individually
programmable backlit keys with 16 million colors.

RazerTOP is a daemon that collects memory and CPU usage statistics and displays that
information as colored keys mimicking [Htop's interface](https://hisham.hm/htop/).

RazerTOP depends on the [OpenRazer](https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer) driver.
